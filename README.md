# Preface

The primary purpose of the handbook is to give an idea of using galaxy to non-bioinformatics people from beginner level for their scientific data analysis in The Sainsbury Laboratory \(TSL\). New starters/students join TSL from various backgrounds and levels. Most of them are biologists and lab-based. Their work produce huge amount of next generation DNA sequence raw data and analysis of the data require high performance computing \(HPC\). Data analysis on HPC require some level of background knowledge in computer programming. But biologist are from non-computing background. TSL supports lab-based biologists providing easy-to-use Galaxy platform.

This handbook will show you the Galaxy's basic functionality, simple data manipulation, data analysis, visualization and creating workflow. .
