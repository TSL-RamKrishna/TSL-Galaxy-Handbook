# Getting Started

Once you are ready to start using galaxy, create a new history as shown in the figure below.

By default, you get an unnamed history. Double click on "Unnamed history" and type the name you want to give to your analysis. For example, if you are mapping E.coli RNA-seq data to a reference sequence, give a name like "Mapping E.coli RNA-seq data". 

# Uploading your local raw data

The first thing users need is their raw data to work on galaxy. Users can upload the data on their local computer drive as shown in the figures below.
