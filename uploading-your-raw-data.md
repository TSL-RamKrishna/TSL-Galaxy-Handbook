# Getting Started

Once you are ready to start using galaxy, create a new history as shown in the figure below.

By default, you get an unnamed history. Double click on "Unnamed history" and type the name you want to give to your analysis. For example, if you are mapping E.coli RNA-seq data to a reference sequence, give a meaningful name like "Map E.coli RNA-seq data 1st Feb 2017".

# Upload raw data from local drive

Users can upload raw data on their local computer drive by any one method as shown in the figures below.
