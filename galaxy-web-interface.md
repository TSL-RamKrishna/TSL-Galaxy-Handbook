# Galaxy web Interface

After successful login, users see galaxy web interface.

The Galaxy's web interface is straightforward. There are three sections. The left column contains links to the downloading, preparation and analysis tools. The center column is where the menus and data will appear. The right hand column shows the history of analysis steps, allows to view data and results, and more \(see figure below\).
