# View File

A data file can be view by clicking a little eye icon at the side of the data filename. See a figure below:

![](/assets/view_file.png)

If the file is huge in size, only the first 1 MB of the data is displayed in the center region of the window.

A file of any text data format can be viewed. If the data is in binary format, galaxy downloads it for you.
