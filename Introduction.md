## About Galaxy

Galaxy is a framework for integrating computational tools that are typically run from the command line into a graphical interface. It allows nearly any tool that can be run from the command line to be wrapped in a well-defined interface. 

Galaxy provides an accessible environment for interactive analysis that transparently tracks the details of analysis steps, a workflow system for convenient reuse, data management, sharing, and publishing.

At TSL, Galaxy is installed in the cluster. It can be accessed at [https://galaxy.tsl.ac.uk](https://galaxy.tsl.ac.uk).
