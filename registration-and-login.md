[DM]: <> (Put yourself in the place of the user. Have you given them enough information to do what you need them to do -quick answer - no! If this is material that they need to get going then it should be in the preface, shouldn't it. Try to use more structuring in the pages of the document to make it read better: e.g How to register? How to login? )
