# FASTQ Quality Control

Galaxy has a tool - **FASTQC** for quality control. FASTQ data quality control aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further analysis.
