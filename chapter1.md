# Introduction

Galaxy is a framework for integrating computational tools. It allows nearly any tool that can be run from the command line to be wrapped in a well-defined interface. On top of these tools, Galaxy provides an accessible environment for interactive analysis that transparently tracks the details of analysis steps, a workflow system for convenient reuse, data management, sharing, and publishing.

Galaxy is available as an open, web-based platform for data intensive life science research that enables non-bioinformaticians to create, run, tune and share their own bioinformatic analyses.

Galaxy can be used on a local desktop computer, in a network server or on cloud based server.

In TSL, galaxy is installed in a network server. It can be accessed using this link [https://galaxy.tsl.ac.uk](https://galaxy.tsl.ac.uk/).
