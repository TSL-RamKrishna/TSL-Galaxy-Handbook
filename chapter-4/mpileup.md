# Mpileup from alignment

A pileup is a variant calling format file. This file basically has a base information from short sample reads for every base in the reference sequences. If no base information is found in short sample reads, it is indicated by &lt;X&gt;. Generally, this file is huge in size as it is carrying information for all base positions in the reference sequences.

Let's do mpileup analysis for the mapping output file \(sorted BAM file\).

From the tool panel, select **Mpileup**.
