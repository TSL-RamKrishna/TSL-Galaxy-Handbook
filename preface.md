# Preface

The purpose of this handbook is to give a new user an introduction to the Galaxy environment for bioinformatics.

This handbook will introduce you to the TSL Galaxy installation, it's basic functionality, show you how to do some straightforward data manipulation and analysis, visualization and creating workflows.

## Introduction to Galaxy

Galaxy is a framework for integrating computational tools. It allows nearly any tool that can be run from the command line to be wrapped in a well-defined interface. On top of these tools, Galaxy provides an accessible environment for interactive analysis that transparently tracks the details of analysis steps, a workflow system for convenient reuse, data management, sharing, and publishing.

Galaxy is available as an open, web-based platform for data intensive life science research that enables non-bioinformaticians to create, run, tune and share their own bioinformatic analyses.

Galaxy can be used on a local desktop computer, in a network server or on cloud based server.

## Prerequisites
